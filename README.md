start coding cub3d project let's go BismiAllah

- we should take care of: 
						Not understanding the math will make debugging a nightmare. Try to understand at least a small part of it.
						Make sure you can move with a continuous key press — I don’t want to click W a thousand times…
						Implementing variable move speed and rotation speed. It will prevent your program from running 
						like the speed of light on X’s computer, and as slow as a snail on Y’s computer.
						Make moving and rotating smooth. It’s not a requirement, but it’ll wow your peers.
